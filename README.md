# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrika Kapoor

I’m a Master’s student in **Medical Informatics** at Heidelberg University and Heilbronn University of Applied Sciences,  
with a specialization in **Data Science**.

My academic background in **Medical Engineering** blends engineering principles with computer science – giving me a solid foundation to solve complex, real-world problems.  
During my semester abroad at the **University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee**, I discovered my passion for working with data in **international, interdisciplinary teams**.

## 💡 What drives me

I love turning **data into decisions** – especially when the data is raw, messy, or unstructured.  
Whether in **healthcare** or **finance**, I enjoy finding clarity in complexity: uncovering patterns, explaining them clearly, and helping teams take action.

What motivates me is making data truly **useful** – not just technically correct, but impactful for real people and real problems.

## 🛠️ How I Work With Data

I combine **analytical thinking** with practical tools to build solutions that matter.

- I use **Python** and **SQL** to explore and structure data, build machine learning models, and automate workflows.
- With **Power BI** and **Excel**, I create dashboards that reveal trends and support decision-making – tailored to stakeholder needs.
- I work in **Jupyter Notebooks** to ensure transparency and reproducibility from raw data to insights.
- I create visualizations (Matplotlib, Seaborn) that don’t just look good – they **tell a story**.
